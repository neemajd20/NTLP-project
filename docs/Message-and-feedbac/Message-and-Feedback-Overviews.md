# Message and Feedback


## 8.1. Message and Feedback Overviews

DHIS2 has functions that allow you to send messages and feedback to users, user groups, and organization units. Feedback messages are sent to a specific group called the **feedback recipient group**. Messages can also be sent between users (user-to-user), depending on your system configuration. The system can send system-generated messages triggered by events like validation analysis results. To open the message app, click the message icon in the header bar or find the **Messaging app** in the search field.
