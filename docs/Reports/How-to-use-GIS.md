# How to Use GIS

Geographical Information System (GIS) is a system designed to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, manage, and present all types of geographical/geospatial data. GIS is applied in the modeling of TB and Leprosy reports, associating it with geospatial/geographical information. Some uses include:

1. Visualizing distributions of TB and Leprosy data per district/region/nation.
2. Breakdown of TB and Leprosy services per region/district and identifying geographical barriers and health inequalities.
3. Visualizing periodic reporting of TB and Leprosy data, such as:
   - Monthly
   - Quarterly
   - Semi-annually
   - Annually
