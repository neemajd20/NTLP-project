##  Introduction to Reporting Functionality

There are several ways to view and use the data through reports. A report in this case refers to different presentations of data, i.e. charts, graphs, tables, and others. The reporting module in DHIS 2 provides a range of reporting alternatives, and this section will explain how the eTL Register uses some of them to view and analyze data.

1. **Standard reports:** Standard reports are listings or summary tables of selected indicator(s) for a particular organization unit and period. These reports can also combine multiple tables and charts in the same report and be made available as one-click reports that are very easy to use. These reports can be downloaded as PDF files, making them ideal for printing and sharing offline.
2. **Dashboard:** The fastest way to view TB and Leprosy indicators. Essentially, the Dashboard is a tool to visualize updated charts as well as shortcuts to your favorite reports, report tables, and map views. Here you can visualize TB and Leprosy indicators in charts.
3. **Pivot Tables:** The built-in pivot table tool is a web-based tool to display indicator data by organization unit and period in a typical pivot table view and allows for pivoting manipulations of the tables. It allows for large amounts of data to be downloaded offline for analysis as well.
4. **Data Visualizer:** Do flexible visualizations of your data as charts and data tables. Any number of indicators and data elements can be included. Several chart types are available, such as column, stacked column, line, area, and pie charts. The charts can be saved in order to be easily retrieved later and can also be put on your personal dashboard. Charts can be downloaded as image and PDF files to your local computer.
5. **GIS:** Present and analyze your data using thematic maps. You can view both data elements and indicators, and given that you have coordinates for all your organization units, you can drill down the hierarchy and view maps for all levels from country polygons to facility points. See the separate chapter on GIS for more details. All the map information is built into the system, and all you need to do is register coordinates for your organization units, and the maps will be available.
