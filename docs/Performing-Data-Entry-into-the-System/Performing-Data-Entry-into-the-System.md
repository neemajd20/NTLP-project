# 3. Performing Data Entry into the System

To enter data into the system or view and/or edit existing cases, we use an application called ETL_v2. To open the ETL_v2 app window, follow these steps:

1. Hover/click on the Apps ![alt text](image.png) menu displayed in the main menus at the upper right, to the left of your name initials. A drop-down menu will appear, listing the applications provided by the system.

2. Click on the ETL_v2 app.
3. If the ETL_v2 app does not appear in the list after step 1 above, type "etl" in the search app text box or scroll up and down to locate ETL_v2 app, then continue with step 2.
4. The Tracker capture app window will open as shown in Figure 6.
