# Dashboard

Dashboards allow users to have quick access to data stored in the system. A dashboard serves as a landing page once the eTL Register is accessed. Dashboards have a title, description, and any number of dashboard items. These items can be of different types, including charts, maps, reports, tables, resources, messages, and text items. Above the dashboard is the control bar, which shows all available dashboards, a dashboard search field, and a **+** button for creating a new dashboard.

The dashboard has two modes: **view** and **edit/create**. When you first log in to DHIS2, your most recently used dashboard will be displayed in view mode if you are using the same computer. If using a different computer, the first starred dashboard will be displayed. If there are no starred dashboards, the first dashboard will be shown. Starred dashboards always appear first in the dashboard list.

Sample dashboards in eTL are accessed from the control bar. Figure 63 is an example of a dashboard on the systemâ€™s home page. To move from one dashboard to another, simply click the dashboard name. To access more dashboards, click the "Show more" option in the bar.
