#  Saving a Dashboard

When creating or editing a dashboard, changes are only saved when you click the **Save changes** button in the dashboard edit bar at the top of the page. If you donâ€™t want to save your changes, click the **Exit without saving** button in the upper right. You will then return to view mode with the dashboard you were previously viewing.
