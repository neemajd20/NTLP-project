#  DS TB Treatment Outcome

Every DS TB case must have an outcome that reflects what happened at the end of treatment. Treatment outcome can occur at any point or at the end of the treatment course. The system automatically calculates the number of days a patient stayed in treatment, starting from when treatment began. To record treatment outcome, follow these steps:

1. Go to the DS-TB Treatment Outcome stage.
2. Select Date treatment ended.
