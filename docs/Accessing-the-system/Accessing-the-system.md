# 1. Accessing the System

Electronic Case Based TB and Leprosy System is the web-based system used to collect, store, and analyze information on TB and leprosy patients. The system also monitors progress on the treatment of TB and Leprosy patients from when registered throughout to treatment completion. The system contains two registers; eTB Register (created by merging TB, DR-TB, and Laboratory register) and eLeprosy Register (merger of leprosy Unit register LEP 03 and POD register lep05) (DHIS2-ETL2).

The system is web-based, hence accessible over the internet using a web browser at [https://etl.moh.go.tz/tracker/](https://etl.moh.go.tz/tracker/)
