# Selecting and Entering Data into EQA Form

To start entering data, first open or select the correct form. Then follow these steps:

1. Select the organization unit (e.g. **Central TB Reference Laboratory**) where you want to register or enter data in the tree menu to the left. Expand and close branches by clicking on the +/- symbols.
2. Select a dataset/data entry form (e.g. **Form 3: Re-checking of Sputum Smear for AFB**) from the dropdown list of data sets available to your selected organization unit. The number of datasets is equivalent to the number of forms available.
3. Select a period (e.g. **January - March 2020**) to register or enter data. The available periods are controlled by the dataset's period type (reporting frequency). You can change the year back or forward by using the **Prev year** and **Next year** buttons.

By completing the above steps, you will see the selected data entry form as shown in Figure 69.

4. Start to enter data in the data entry form by clicking inside the field and typing the value. 

Please note the following:
- A **green field** means that the values have been saved in the system (on the server).
- A **gray field** means that the field is disabled, and you canâ€™t enter a value. The cursor will automatically jump to the next open field.
- To move to the next field, use the **Tab** key or the **Down Arrow** key on your keyboard. To move back to the previous field, press **Shift+Tab** or the **Up Arrow** key.
- The values are saved immediately and do not require any save/finished button click.
- On a slow connection, it might take some time before saving the values.

5. Click **Complete** to save the form.
