# Enter Data Offline

Once you are logged into the online eTL Register, you can continue to enter data even if you have an unstable internet connection.

- This functionality works as long as you have logged in to the system when there is an internet connection.
- When connected to the internet and able to reach the server, the app displays a message at the top of the data entry form as shown in Figure 70.

- If you are in the data entry form and the connection is cut off/unstable, you can still enter data, and these data will be stored on your local computer as shown in Figure 79.
- If the internet connection is lost during data entry, the application detects this, and a message will inform you that your data will be stored locally, as shown in Figure 79.

- When the internet connection is re-established, all data will be sent to the server.
- Once the internet is back, the application detects that the server is online and will inform you that data stored locally should be uploaded to the server.

- Once the data has successfully synchronized with the server, you will receive a confirmation message that the data has been successfully uploaded to the server.
