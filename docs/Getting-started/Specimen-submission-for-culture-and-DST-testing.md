#  Specimen submission for culture and DST testing

At any point during treatment, a follow-up test can be requested by the clinician. During treatment follow-up sessions, a patient must be diagnosed to check whether the mycobacteria are responding to the regimen being taken. If the patient is still positive at the second month, their specimen must be sent for culture and DST. To refer a specimen for culture and DST, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Request for Culture and DST** stage.
