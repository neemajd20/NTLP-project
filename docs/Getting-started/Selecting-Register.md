#  Selecting Register

To start entering records or viewing and editing records, the first step is to open the correct register by following these steps:

1. Locate the organization unit you want to enter/view/edit data in the tree menu to the left by expanding and closing branches using the +/- symbols as follows:
   - Expand the **United Republic of Tanzania**  
   - Expand **Tanzania Mainland** or **Tanzania Zanzibar** depending on the facility  
   - Expand the **Region** to which the facility belongs (e.g. **Arusha Region**)  
   - Expand the **District** to which the facility belongs (e.g. **Arusha City Council**)  
   - Then select the facility (e.g. **AICC Hospital**)

2. Select the appropriate register from the dropdown list of registers available to your selected organization unit. The system has two registers:
   1. eTB Register  
   2. eLeprosy Register

Please note the following:

- **Register**: In its simplest definition, it is a form in which a TB or Leprosy patientâ€™s records are kept and tracked over time.  
- From the **ETL Register v2** perspective, there are two registers so far:
   - **eTB Register**: Tracks each tuberculosis patient from the beginning to the end of treatment. It is comprised of three merged registers from the old system: TB Register, DR-TB Register, Laboratory Register, and a new register, the TPT Register.
   - **eLeprosy Register**: Tracks each leprosy patient from the beginning to the end of treatment. It is comprised of two merged registers from the old system: Leprosy Register and POD Examination Register.
