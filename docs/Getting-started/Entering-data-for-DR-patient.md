#  Entering data for DR patient

A person diagnosed with RR/MDR-TB is required to initiate treatment with 2nd line TB medicines. Follow-up tests are taken to monitor the patient's response to the medicines. Follow-up laboratory test results that are captured in the eTB register include smear microscopy and culture, in addition to weight and height measurements.

## 4.6.1. Entering data for a direct RR/MDR TB patient

Every TB patient must have a TB district number. If a patient is diagnosed with DR-TB at the onset, they must be assigned both TB and DR-TB district numbers. To register a direct DR-TB case, follow these steps:
